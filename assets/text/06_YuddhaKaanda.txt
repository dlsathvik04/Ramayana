Yuddha Kanada, also known as Lanka Kanda, is one of the most captivating sections of the ancient Hindu epic, the Ramayana. It delves into the riveting account of the climactic battle that unfolded in the land of Lanka between the valiant army of Lord Rama, aided by the formidable monkey warriors led by Hanuman and Sugriva, and the mighty demon army commanded by the powerful and arrogant demon king, Ravana. However, the Yuddha Kanda encompasses more than just the intense combat; it encompasses various other significant events, including Sita's test of fire, Rama's ultimate triumph, and the glorious return to Ayodhya. 

Rama appreciates Hanuma and embraces him after hearing his report. Rama was gladden that Hanuma did something worthy of a noble servant. Then, Rama reflected upon the problem of how to cross the ocean. 

Sugreeva comforts Rama, urging him to focus on crossing the ocean rather than dwelling on his grief. Hanuma describes Lanka in detail. Rama sets an auspicious hour for departure, and the army reaches the sea. Rama laments his separation from Seetha, consoled by Lakshmana as the sun sets. Ravana calls a meeting to discuss Rama's potential attack on Lanka. 

The demons boost Ravana's confidence and claim that Indrajit alone can defeat Rama and the monkey army. Demons like Prahasta, Durmukha, Vajradamshtra, Nikumbha, and Vajrahanu boast about their own abilities and assure Ravana that they can individually eliminate Rama's army effortlessly. 

Vibhishana, Ravana's half-brother, warns about the negative omens in the city and the palace. He advises Ravana to return Seetha to Rama as an act of appeasement. Ravana ignores Vibhishana's counsel and dismisses him. 

Ravana consults with his ministers and Vibhishana, discussing defence strategies for Lanka. Prahasta is instructed to position the army for protection. Ravana admits to his infatuation with Seetha and seeks suggestions to kill Rama and Lakshmana. Kumbhakarna criticizes Ravana but promises to defeat the enemies. Ravana mentions a curse that prevents him from forcefully taking Seetha. Vibhishana highlights the monkeys' strength and Rama's powerful arrows. Prahasta claims they are unafraid of Rama. Vibhishana urges returning Seetha to avoid Ravana's downfall. Indrajit argues with Vibhishana, who advises Ravana to return Seetha and live happily in Lanka. Ravana refuses to hear the words of Vibhishana and rebukes him with harsh words. Vibhishana gets angry and sets off, to leave Ravana. 

Vibhishana and his companions approach Rama, seeking refuge. Sugriva voices his distrust of Vibhishana, but Rama seeks opinions from his leaders. Most express reservations except for Hanuman, who believes in Vibhishana's understanding of Rama's virtues and Ravana's flaws. Hanuman urges Rama to make the final decision. 

Rama decides not to abandon Vibhishana, despite initial disagreement from Sugriva. Vibhishana joins Rama's side as an ally. He descends from the sky and seeks refuge at Rama's feet. Upon inquiry, Vibhishana describes Ravana's strength. Rama vows to defeat Ravana and anoints Vibhishana. Rama then sits on the seashore, seeking the assistance of the ocean god to provide a passage for his army to reach Lanka. 

Ravana sends Shuka as an ambassador to Sugriva, but the monkeys harass him. Rama intervenes and saves Shuka. Sugriva responds firmly to Ravana's message. Rama becomes angry with the ocean for not cooperating and shoots arrows, causing terror among sea creatures. 

Before releasing a powerful missile, Rama is advised by the sea god to have a bridge built by Nala. The ocean god disappears after giving this advice. Nala constructs a bridge with the help of other monkeys. 

Rama explains to Lakshmana the various portents, he observes around him, that signal a destructive war fare. He orders for formation of battalions in the army and surges forth together with the battalions towards Lanka. 

Rama observes Lanka and instructs Lakshmana to prepare the army for battle. Shuka, who was captured earlier, is released and relays information to Ravana about Rama's army. Ravana, confident in his own army's strength, crosses the sea while Rama instructs his soldiers.  

Ravana sends spies disguised as monkeys, but they are recognized and captured by Vibhishana. Rama shows mercy and releases them, after which they inform Ravana about the mighty strength of Rama's army and advise him to return Seetha to Rama. 

Ravana climbs his palace roof to observe the monkey army and asks his ministers about the various leaders. The spies describe the strengths and characteristics of the monkey commanders, providing a detailed account. Ravana reprimands them and sends more spies, who are caught and harassed by the monkeys. Rama releases them and they return to Lanka. 

Ravana dispatches a demon-spy named Shardula to gather information about the opposing army. Disturbed to learn that Rama has arrived at Suvela mountain with his army, Ravana consults his ministers and then deceives Seetha with an illusory head and weapons of Rama, claiming he is dead. 

Seetha falls unconscious but is reassured by an ogre named Sarama, who tells her that Rama is alive and stationed at the southern shore of the ocean. Sarama restores her confidence, stating that Rama will defeat Ravana in battle and reunite with her. Meanwhile, Ravana prepares his army for action after being called away briefly. 

Seetha sends Sarama as a spy to Ravana to gather information about her release. Sarama overhears Ravana's conversation and informs Seetha that he has no intention of setting her free. Sarama consoles Seetha, assuring her that Rama will defeat Ravana and rescue her. 

Rama and his army arrive in Lanka with drums and fanfare. Ravana hears the sounds and discusses his next move with his ministers. Malyavan advises Ravana to make peace with Rama and return Seetha, citing ominous signs. Ravana dismisses the advice, insults Malyavan, and vows not to release Seetha. 

Ravana assigns guards to the city gates and retreats to his chambers. Rama, Sugreeva, Hanuman, and others gather to strategize. Vibhishana informs them of his spies' findings about Ravana's defenses. Rama orders his warriors to storm the gates while he stays on Suvela mountain. 

Rama suggests halting on Suvela mountain to observe Lanka. They witness the city's beauty, gardens, and Ravana's palace. Some monkeys explore the gardens, while others head towards Lanka's peak. Sugreeva confronts Ravana atop a gate, engaging in a long duel. Sugreeva eventually defeats Ravana and returns to his troops. 

Rama advises Sugreeva against such recklessness and discusses the evil omens he observed. He orders the monkey-generals to besiege all the gates. Rama and Lakshmana protect the army at the northern gate, facing Ravana. Angada attempts to reason with Ravana but fails. Ravana's attendants try to seize Angada, but he escapes and destroys Ravana's palace. 

The demons inform Ravana of the monkey siege on Lanka. Ravana surveys the city from his mansion and sees the vast monkey army. Rama commands the monkeys to attack, and they destroy defensive structures and besiege the gates. Ravana's army engages in combat, and fierce clashes ensue between demons and monkeys.. 

Intense battles occur between the monkeys and demons. Various duels take place, resulting in bloodshed. The monkeys display bravery and defeat many demons. As night falls, a fierce nocturnal battle ensues, with Rama and Lakshmana fighting valiantly. Indrajit, a powerful demon, captures Rama and Lakshmana with a net of serpentine arrows. 

The monkeys mourn the plight of Rama and Lakshmana. Vibhishana reassures them that Rama will not die and boosts their morale. Indrajit informs Ravana of his success, and Ravana decides to show Seetha the apparent death of Rama and Lakshmana. Seetha becomes distraught, but Trijata offers comforting words and takes her back to the Ashoka grove. 

Rama regains consciousness and laments Lakshmana's condition. Vibhishana approaches Rama, causing the monkeys to mistakenly flee. Jambavan restores their confidence. Garuda appears and frees Rama and Lakshmana from their bondage. 

The monkeys rejoice, and Ravana learns of their liberation. He sends Dhumraksha to kill Rama, Lakshmana, and the monkeys. A fierce battle ensues, resulting in heavy casualties. Hanuman defeats Dhumraksha, and the monkey forces emerge victorious. 

Ravana sends Vajradamstra and his army to attack Rama and the monkeys, stationed at the southern gate. Angada, the monkey leader, fights bravely and beheads the demons.  

Next, Akampana is sent by Ravana, but he is defeated by Hanuman and the monkeys.  

Prahasta enters the battle, but is eventually killed by Nila, a monkey.  

Ravana himself joins the fight but suffers defeat at the hands of Rama and his allies, retreating to Lanka.  

Ravana then wakes up Kumbhakarna, who prepares to join the battle.  

Rama learns about Kumbhakarna's curse and orders his monkey army to position themselves in Lanka.  

Kumbhakarna meets Ravana and is informed about the upcoming battle.  

The monkey army begins their operations upon Rama's orders.  

Kumbhakarna asks Ravana about his task and is told to kill the adversaries. Ravana wants Kumbhakarna to display his formidable strength in battle. 

Kumbhakarna, rebuked by Ravana for disregarding advice and neglecting his duties, reassures him of victory in battle. Mahodara supports Ravana's actions and suggests a non-combative strategy. Kumbhakarna rejects the advice and vows to annihilate Rama. Ravana decorates Kumbhakarna and sends him to battle, despite bad omens. The monkeys initially flee upon seeing Kumbhakarna's colossal form, but Angada rallies them back. The battle ensues with mountains and spikes being hurled. Kumbhakarna defeats some monkeys but faces resistance. Sugreeva is captured but later rescued by tearing off Kumbhakarna's body parts. Lakshmana and Rama attack him, rendering him weaponless. The monkeys climb Kumbhakarna and Rama finally kills him. Ravana laments Kumbhakarna's death and regrets ignoring Vibhishana's advice. Trishira and Ravana's other sons join the battle but face resistance from the monkeys. Narantaka dies in combat with Angada. 

Angada engages in combat with Mahodara, Trishira, and Devantaka. Hanuma and Neela join the fight. Devantaka is killed by Hanuma, while Neela defeats Mahodara. Hanuma and Trishira clash, and Hanuma ultimately slays him. Rishabha eliminates Mahaparshva. 

Atikaya, Ravana's son, approaches Rama, and Lakshmana confronts him. They exchange blows, and Atikaya injures Lakshmana. Enraged, Lakshmana retaliates with a fiery arrow, and Atikaya counters with a solar missile. With guidance from the wind-god, Lakshmana uses a divine arrow to decapitate Atikaya. 

Upon learning of the deaths of Atikaya, Dhumraksha, Akampana, Prahasta, and Kumbhakarna, Ravana grows anxious. He realizes that Rama, Lakshmana, Sugreeva, and Vibhishana are formidable opponents. Ravana instructs his army to protect Lanka and the captive Seetha in Ashoka garden, and he retreats to his palace, grieving over Atikaya's loss. 

Indrajit, Ravana's son, witnessing his father's despair, vows to defeat Rama and Lakshmana. He leads his army into battle, performs a sacrificial ritual, and becomes invisible. Indrajit showers arrows upon the monkeys, causing them to lose consciousness. He strikes down key monkey-warriors with his maces and arrows. Rama suggests feigning unconsciousness to deceive Indrajit and make him return to Lanka in false victory. Severely wounded, Rama, Lakshmana, and the monkey army fall unconscious on the battlefield. 

Rama and Lakshmana are rendered unconscious by Brahma's missile, along with numerous monkeys. Hanuma and Vibhishana remain conscious and search for Jambavan. They locate him and Jambavan instructs Hanuma to fetch four crucial herbs from the Himalayas to revive the fallen monkeys. Hanuma embarks on his journey and finds the herbs on Mount Rishabha. He brings them back, and upon inhaling their aroma, Rama, Lakshmana, and the monkeys recover. 

Sugreeva orders Hanuma to set fire to Lanka. Monkeys armed with torches set the city ablaze, causing widespread destruction. Rama and Lakshmana recover and resume fighting, demolishing gates and buildings with their arrows. Ravana sends his sons Kumbha and Nikumbha, along with other demons, to battle the monkeys. The monkeys surround and engage the demon army. 

Angada kills Kampana and injures Shonitaksha. He, along with Mainda and Dvivida, confronts Shonitaksha, Yupaksha, and Prajangha. Angada eliminates Prajangha, while Dvivida and Mainda defeat Shonitaksha and Yupaksha, respectively. Rama dispatches more monkey-chiefs led by Jambavan after Kumbha throws Angada down. Sugreeva delivers a powerful blow, killing Kumbha. 

Nikumbha becomes furious upon witnessing his brother's death. He wields an iron club and confronts the battle. Hanuma engages Nikumbha, striking his chest with great force. Nikumbha lifts Hanuma, but Hanuma manages to free himself and throws Nikumbha to the ground. Hanuma then pounds Nikumbha's chest, seizes his head, and tears it off, ending his life. 

Ravana commands Makaraksha to attack Rama, Lakshmana, and the monkeys with his army. Makaraksha advances, but his whip and flagstaff fall due to divine intervention, followed by a dust storm. Ignoring these signs, Makaraksha's army proceeds, intending to reach Rama and Lakshmana. 

As Makaraksha enters the battlefield, another battle erupts between the monkeys and demons. The monkeys panic at Makaraksha's arrows and begin to flee. However, Rama intervenes and showers the demons with arrows. Makaraksha challenges Rama to face him, and a fierce exchange of arrows ensues. Eventually, Rama destroys Makaraksha's chariot, horses, and finally kills him with a mystic missile. Terrified, the demons retreat to Lanka. 

Ravana sends Indrajit to the battlefield. Indrajit performs sacred rituals, granting him the power to become invisible while fighting. He attacks Rama and Lakshmana with a barrage of arrows, causing casualties among the monkey army. Rama and Lakshmana strategize on how to defeat Indrajit. 

Indrajit tricks Rama by displaying an illusion of Sita and kills the image. Hanuma and the monkeys engage in battle with the demons, using trees and rocks as weapons. Indrajit inflicts heavy casualties on the monkey army, and Hanuma eventually returns to Rama. 

Hanuma informs Rama that Indrajit has killed Sita, causing Rama to faint. Rama is revived, and Lakshmana comforts him, discussing the concepts of vice and virtue. Lakshmana prepares to fight Indrajit. 

Vibhishana finds Rama unconscious and informs him that Sita is still alive, explaining Indrajit's trick. Vibhishana suggests sending Lakshmana with an army to the sanctuary of Nikumbhila. 

Vibhishana advises Rama to send Lakshmana to kill Indrajit before he finishes the sacrificial fire. Rama agrees and assembles an army including Sugreeva, Hanuma, Jambavan, and Vibhishana. Lakshmana, accompanied by Hanuma, Vibhishana, and Jambavan, heads to the sanctuary of Nikumbhila to confront Indrajit. They engage in a battle against the enemy army. 

Following Vibhishana's advice, Lakshmana showers Indrajit with arrows. The fight intensifies, drawing the attention of Indrajit who abandons the sacrificial rite. Hanuma wreaks havoc among the demons using trees as weapons and challenges Indrajit to a duel. Lakshmana spots Indrajit approaching in his chariot. 

Vibhishana leads Lakshmana to the location of Indrajit's sacrificial rite under a banyan tree, urging him to defeat Indrajit before he completes it. Indrajit notices Vibhishana and berates him, accusing him of betraying him by bringing Lakshmana to the spot. Vibhishana explains his reasons for joining Rama's side and predicts that Indrajit and his army won't survive against Lakshmana's arrows. 

A fierce archery battle commences between Lakshmana and Indrajit. Indrajit strikes Lakshmana, Hanuma, and Vibhishana with numerous arrows simultaneously. In response, Lakshmana rains down a barrage of arrows, shattering Indrajit's armor. Indrajit retaliates by showering Lakshmana with a thousand arrows, breaking his armor as well.

Lakshmana destroys Indrajit's chariot, and Indrajit strikes three arrows at Lakshmana's forehead while Lakshmana strikes five arrows at Indrajit's face. Vibhishana kills Indrajit's horses when he shoots arrows at him. 

Lakshmana prays to Rama and fires a missile at Indrajit, guided by Indra. Indrajit's head is severed and falls to the ground. The monkey chiefs, Vibhishana, Hanuma, and Jambavan rejoice at Indrajit's death, applauding Lakshmana. 

Lakshmana and Vibhishana inform Rama about the victory. Rama embraces Lakshmana, delighted by the news. Sushena treats Lakshmana and the others. After receiving medical treatment, Lakshmana recovers and feels joyful. 

Ravana, distraught by his son's death, decides to kill Seetha. He rushes towards her with a sword but is advised by his minister to redirect his anger towards Rama in battle. Ravana accepts the advice and retreats. His army marches forward to fight Rama, but the monkeys seek refuge in Rama as the demons attack them. Rama swiftly destroys the demon troops. The female-demons lament the deaths caused by the combat and blame Surpanakha for bringing Seetha to Lanka. They predict Ravana's downfall. Enraged by their grief, Ravana orders his army to set out for battle and promises revenge. As he marches, he sees bad omens foretelling his death. The monkeys return to the battle, and a fierce fight ensues between them and the demons. Ravana fights fiercely but is interrupted when Sugreeva and the monkeys attack and kill some demon chiefs.

Rama and Ravana battle fiercely. Rama receives powerful weapons from Indra and strikes Ravana's horses and body with arrows. They exchange harsh words and Rama promises to defeat Ravana. Rama relentlessly attacks with arrows and mystic missiles, weakening Ravana. Ravana's charioteer takes him away but is instructed to return to the battle. Rama recites prayers for victory. Ravana's chariot returns, and a fierce battle resumes. Rama destroys Ravana's flag and cuts off his heads, but they regenerate. The intense encounter lasts for seven days. 

Rama follows Matali's advice and uses a powerful arrow given by Brahma to kill Ravana. Vibhishana mourns Ravana's death, but Rama assures him that fallen warriors need not be mourned. Vibhishana describes Ravana's qualities and seeks permission to perform his funeral rites. Rama grants him permission and Vibhishana carries out the rituals. Ravana's consorts lament his death and regret his actions. Mandodari recognizes Rama as Vishnu and acknowledges that Ravana's death is a consequence of his sinful deeds. She praises Ravana's prowess but wonders how he was defeated by a mortal. After the funeral, Vibhishana joins Rama and they rejoice in their victory over their enemy. 

Matali, Indra's charioteer, returns to heaven. Rama tells Lakshmana to crown Vibhishana as the King of Lanka. Sea-water is collected and sprinkled on Vibhishana in the presence of demons. Rama sends Hanuma to deliver a message to Seetha. Vibhishana brings Seetha to Rama. Rama tells Seetha that their honor has been restored through victory. However, Rama doubts Seetha's faithfulness and disowns her. Seetha taunts Rama and asks for a pyre. She prays to the fire-god and enters the flames. Gods question Rama's actions. Rama reveals his divinity. The fire-god carries Seetha from the pyre and returns her to Rama. Rama happily accepts her. 

Lord Shiva tells Rama that his father Dasaratha has arrived in a celestial car with Indra. Rama and Lakshmana pay their respects to Dasaratha. Dasaratha advises Rama to return to Ayodhya, meet Bharata, and become king. He tells Lakshmana and Sita to serve Rama. Dasaratha then leaves with Indra. Rama asks Indra to bring the dead monkeys back to life, which is granted. The monkeys rest, and Rama prepares to leave for Ayodhya. Vibhishana offers hospitality, but Rama declines, wanting to see his family and people in Ayodhya. Vibhishana arranges the car Pushpaka for their journey. 

Rama commands Vibhishana to honor the monkeys with gifts. They all ascend the aerial car and Rama permits them to accompany him to Ayodhya. During their journey, Rama shows Seetha various significant places, and they land at Bharadwaja's hermitage. Rama inquires about Ayodhya's welfare and receives positive news. Bharadwaja reveals his knowledge of Rama's exploits and grants Rama's request to make trees bear off-season fruits. The monkeys enjoy a feast on these fruits. 

Rama asks Hanuma to go to Shringaberapura and inform Guha about his well-being and ask for directions to Ayodhya. He also instructs Hanuma to travel to Ayodhya and inform Bharata about his welfare and the events in the forest and Lanka, including the abduction of Seetha and the defeat of Ravana. Rama wants Hanuma to let Bharata know that they are near Ayodhya with Sugreeva and Vibhishana. Hanuma meets Guha and Bharata in Nandigrama and shares the good news about Rama's well-being and imminent return. Bharata is thrilled and rewards Hanuma for delivering the pleasant news. Hanuma then recounts the details of Rama's journey from the day Bharata took his wooden sandals to the day Ravana was killed. Bharata, upon hearing the news, instructs Shatrughna to prepare for Rama's reception in Ayodhya. They all travel to Nandigrama, where Rama and his companions land. Bharata warmly welcomes them and places Rama's sandals at his feet. Rama commands the aerial car, Pushpaka, to return to Kubera, its original owner. 

At the request of Bharata to take back the kingdom of Ayodhya, Rama accepts the offer and sits on a seat. Bharata and Rama take their bath and get adorned for the occasion. Rama, mounting on an excellent chariot, sallies forth on a procession in the city accompanied by Bharata, Shatrughna, Lakshmana and Vibhishana. Nine thousand elephants follow the procession, with Sugreeva and other monkeys mounted on them. Some attendants and musicians with their musical instruments walk in front of Rama's procession. The citizens of Ayodhya host flags on every house. Rama returns to his paternal palace in Ayodhya. Sugreeva orders four of his monkeys to bring water from four oceans in jars given to them. Some monkeys brought water from five hundred rivers, as also from the four oceans for the purpose of the ceremony. Vasishta along with other brahmins as priests caused Rama to be consecrated with that water. The virgins, ministers, warriors, merchants, the four gods as well as other gods sprinkled sap of all kinds of herbs on Rama. Vasishta and other priests officiating the coronation-ceremony adorned Rama with an auspicious and charming crown. Then, Rama gives away presents to the priests as well as Sugreeva and Angada. Rama presents a pearl-necklace to Seetha and Seetha presents that necklace in turn to Hanuma. Rama further gives away presents to Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Jambavan and others on the occasion. Rama bids farewell to monkeys. The glory of the epic is complemented in the end by Valmiki.
