The Ayodhya Kanda takes us on a profound journey through a series of interconnected stories that shape the narrative and explore the depths of human emotions and the timeless themes of righteousness, loyalty, sacrifice, manipulation, and the power of love and forgiveness. 

The story begins with the righteous and wise King Dasaratha of Ayodhya, a beloved ruler respected by all. King Dasaratha holds deep affection for his eldest son, Rama, who possesses exceptional virtues and leadership qualities. Recognizing Rama's unparalleled character, Dasaratha firmly believes that his noble son is the most deserving candidate to ascend the throne and ensure the prosperity and welfare of Ayodhya. Driven by his commitment to righteousness, Dasaratha makes the decision to make Rama his successor, intending to uphold dharma (righteousness) and the well-being of his kingdom. 

Dasaratha's decision to make Rama the king of Ayodhya sets in motion a chain of events that shapes the narrative of the Ayodhya Kanda.  

Kaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned shortly. She generously gifted valuable jewellery to those who conveyed this good news to her. At the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha and Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Sastruga’s mother was also happy to hear the news. 

However, amidst this joyous occasion, a sinister plot unfolds. Manthara, a housemaid who was residing with Kaikeyi since her birth, accidentally ascended the balcony of Kaikeyi's white palace, which resembled the full moon. Manthara, from that balcony, saw the entire city of Ayodhya, with all its principal roads being sprinkled with water and strewn with heaps of flowers. Manthara asked a housemaid with bright pleasing eyes and wearing white silk clothes standing nearby, "Why is Kausalya giving away money to people so delightfully today in charity, even though she is badly lured by money?", "Why are people so happy today? Is the king duly pleased with something, doing any great act? Tell me." 

That housemaid, bursting with joy, told Manthara in a great gladdening tone about the great honour to be conferred upon Rama. 

"Tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star, King Dasaratha is going to anoint the fault-less Rama for the princely kingdom." 

After hearing the words of that maid, the wicked maid Manthara feels very sad after hearing about the anointment of Rama for the princely kingdom sensing her interests being threatened by Rama's rise to power, manipulates Queen Kaikeyi. Exploiting Kaikeyi's insecurities and fears for the future of her son, Bharata, Manthara cunningly poisons Kaikeyi's mind against Rama. Consumed by jealousy and anger, Kaikeyi succumbs to Manthara's manipulations and Remembers Dasaratha what happened in the battle between celestials and demons in the olden times. And how she saved him. Hence, he gives boons to her, and she now demands her boons to be given now the first wish is, that Bharatha should be crowned the king, and her second wish, Rama should live in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years.  

Dasaratha after hearing this, is shocked by the strange wishes of Kaikeyi and tries to convince Kaikeyi of her wishes as being harmful. Kaikeyi would not heed the emperor's words. After hearing the cruel words of Kaikeyi, King Dasaratha got disturbed and suffered great agony for a while. 

Thinking over this, the king could not make out on the spur of the moment what it was. Then, regaining consciousness, he felt tormented by Kaikeyi's words. Distressed and disgusted he was seated on the bare floor he gave forth a long sigh like a highly venomous serpent fixed to a charmed spot through magic spells. Uttering words "What a pity!" the angry king fell into a swoon once more, his mind infatuated with grief. Regaining consciousness after a long time and feeling much distressed and angry, he pleads with Kaikeyi to take back the boons she asked for. 

Kaikeyi replied by saying 

"Oh, the evil-minded! By giving up righteousness and by installing Rama in the kingdom, you want to enjoy life with Kausalya forever." 

"Let it be unrighteous or righteous, real or hoax. There should be no change in whatever is promised by you for me." 

"If Rama is coroneted, I shall indeed die before your eyes by drinking abundant poison now itself in front of you." 

"If I have to see Kausalya, the mother of Rama receiving salutations even for a day, death is indeed better for me." 

Hearing Kaikeyi's boons, asking for Rama's exile and Bharata's sovereignty which are very much unwelcome, King Dasaratha nevertheless was perturbed for a while and did not move his lips towards Kaikeyi. 

He kept gazing with unwinking eyes towards his beloved queen Kaikeyi, who spoke such disagreeable words. The king could not become comfortable hearing that utterance, which was unkindly to his heart filling with pain and sorrow and was as terrible as a thunderbolt. 

Reflecting on Kaikeyi's resolve and her terrible swearing, Dasaratha heaved a sigh, uttering "Rama" and fell like a tree which was cut off. 

The king spoke to Kaikeyi in a distressed tone as follows "By whom have you been taught this worthless thing which appears to be worthwhile? Like a woman whose mind has been perverted by an evil spirit, you are not ashamed to speak to me." 

"Seeing Rama dwelling in a great forest and Seetha lamenting, I cannot indeed desire to line." 

There is no life to me without my son. How can there be happiness moreover? From whom else can there be joy, while I survive? Oh, queen! You ought not to do an unfriendly act to me. Be gracious to me." 

King Dasahratha just could not control his emotions and wept bitterly the heartbroken Dasharatha, bound by his promise to Kaikeyi, is left with no choice but to comply. 

The news of Rama's exile shocks the entire city of Ayodhya. The citizens, who revered Rama as their beloved prince and rightful ruler, are filled with grief and disbelief. The streets that were once filled with joy and anticipation are now clouded with sorrow. The people of Ayodhya cannot fathom a world without Rama's righteous rule. Meanwhile, Rama accepts his fate with grace and prepares for his exile. He reassures his grieving father, Dasharatha, that he will fulfil his duty and return after the fourteen-year period. Rama's acceptance of exile despite his rightful claim to the throne showcases his commitment to duty and his ability to put the well-being of the kingdom above personal desires. The depth of Rama's sacrifice evokes a profound sense of admiration and reverence, as he willingly endures separation from his family and the comforts of palace life to fulfil his father's promise. 

Rama's unwavering devotion to his duty and his selflessness inspire admiration and reverence among the people of Ayodhya. They witness the embodiment of an ideal prince, who willingly sacrifices his kingdom and comforts for the sake of honouring his father's promise. 

As Rama prepares to leave, Sita and Lakshmana vow to accompany him in his exile. Sita, a devoted wife and an epitome of virtue, insists on accompanying her husband, rejecting the comforts of palace life. Lakshmana, Rama's loyal brother, pledges his unwavering support and decides to serve Rama during his time in the forest. The departure of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana leaves Ayodhya engulfed in deep sorrow. The once-vibrant city becomes a place of mourning, as its residents struggle to cope with the absence of their beloved prince. Dasharatha, overwhelmed with grief and guilt, succumbs to the pain and breathes his last, leaving behind a kingdom in mourning.  

The Ayodhya Kanda concludes with the ascension of Bharata, Rama's younger brother, as the king of Ayodhya. Bharata, who was away at his maternal uncle's kingdom during the events, is devastated upon learning about the exile of Rama and the passing of his father. He vehemently refuses to accept the throne and instead travels to the forest to persuade Rama to return. The Ayodhya Kanda reflects the profound impact of Rama's exile on the people and the city itself. The narrative showcases the ideals of duty, sacrifice, and honour, embodied by Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana. It also highlights the love and devotion that the citizens of Ayodhya hold for their prince, as well as the turmoil they experience upon his departure.  

Sita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that Rama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and arrows. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits.  

Meanwhile, Bharata, Rama's younger brother, returns to Ayodhya and learns about the treacherous events that unfolded in his absence. Devastated by the news of Rama's banishment and the manipulations of his mother, Kaikeyi, Bharata rejects his mother's demands and refuses to accept the throne. Filled with love and loyalty towards Rama, Bharata firmly upholds his brother's rightful place as the king, understanding the injustice inflicted upon him. Bharata's rejection of the throne showcases his unwavering devotion to Rama and his commitment to upholding righteousness, even when faced with familial conflicts. 

Driven by his deep remorse and desire to correct the wrongs, Bharata embarks on a journey to the forest to find Rama and request his return to Ayodhya. Overwhelmed by guilt for the actions of his mother, Bharata seeks forgiveness from Rama. In a poignant encounter, Bharata humbly pleads with Rama to come back and assume his rightful place as the king. However, bound by his father's promise to Kaikeyi and unwavering in his commitment to dharma, Rama insists on completing his fourteen-year exile. Bharata, understanding and respecting Rama's decision, accepts his fate and takes Rama's sacred sandals back to Ayodhya. Keeping Rama's sandals on his head, Bharata ascends his chariot along with Shatrughna. Bharata advances along with his troops alongside the mountain of Chitrakuta. On the way, he beholds Bharadvaja's hermitage and meets the sage. Bharata informs the sage about the insistence of Rama to stay back in the forest for fourteen years so as to honour the promise of his father scrupulously and also Vasishta’s advice to Rama to offer his sandals to Bharata, to ensure peace and harmony in Ayodhya. 

The meeting between Bharata and Rama showcases the deep bond of love and respect between the two brothers. It highlights Bharata's unwavering devotion to Rama and his commitment to upholding his brother's honour and rightful place as the king of Ayodhya. This incident serves as a testament to the enduring power of familial love and sacrifice, demonstrating the strength of brotherhood and the capacity to rise above personal desires for the greater good. 

He places the sandals on the throne, symbolizing Rama's authority, and rules as a regent in Rama's absence, ensuring that Ayodhya remains devoted to Rama's ideals and eagerly awaits his eventual return. After returning to Ayodhya, Bharata expresses his desire to proceed to Nandigrama village. Vasishta and the other elders agree to his proposal. Bharata along with Shatrughna ascend the chariot and proceed towards Nandigram. The ministers, family-priest, the army and the citizens of Ayodhya followed Bharata in his journey. Installing the wooden sandals of Rama on the royal throne, Bharata puts on the garb of an ascetic and carries on the rule under orders of the sandals, holding the royal canopy over them  

Sri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded him of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area and move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, leading a peaceful, contented life. 

Rama, after due reflection, decides to leave Chitrakuta mountain because of many handicaps. Setting out his journey from Chitrakuta mountain, he reaches the hermitage of Sage Atri and offers his salutation to him. Introducing his wife Anansuya as a great female ascetic to Rama, Atri urges Rama to send his concert Seetha to Anasuya. Anasuya receives Seetha, who greeted her and gives her instructions on the role and responsibilities of a devoted wife. 

Seetha agrees to the instructions given by Anasuya on the duties of a devoted wife. At the end of the conversation with Seetha, Anasuya requests her to ask for a boon, and highly pleased with her, Anasuya bestows heavenly flowers and ornaments on her. As the evening twilight approaches, Anasuya sends Seetha to Rama's presence. Seetha approaches Rama and shows him the apparel, jewels, and garlands gifted by Anasuya and duly adorned by her, Rama spends the night there along with Seetha Lakshmana. At the onset of dawn, they take leave of the ascetics and advance further into the great forest on the route suggested by the ascetics. 

Ayodhya Kanda of the Ramayana depicts a critical turning point in the epic, where Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana embrace their exile with humility and grace, while Ayodhya is left in mourning. It showcases the unwavering loyalty and sacrifice of the characters involved and sets the stage for the subsequent chapters of the epic, leading to the eventual triumph of good over evil.
