Many of these forests had sages living in them. Many more had demons in them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives of the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. When Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis welcomed them, and offered them fruits and nuts.

They build simple cottages and lead a peaceful life, subsisting on fruits, roots, and the bounties of nature. The forest becomes their sanctuary, offering solace and tranquillity amidst the trials of exile. 

However, their existence is disrupted when they encounter Surpanakha, a rakshasa woman and the sister of Ravana, the formidable demon king of Lanka.

She approaches him with amorous intentions, but Rama, bound by his unwavering love and devotion for Sita, politely declines her advances. Enraged and humiliated, Surpanakha turns her attention to Sita, seeing her as an obstacle to her desires.

In the ensuing conflict, Lakshmana cuts off Surpanakha's nose and ears, rendering her disfigured. This act triggers a series of events that set the stage for the dramatic developments to come.

However, Rama, endowed with divine strength and skill, single-handedly annihilates Khara and his demonic forces, displaying his prowess as a warrior and protector of righteousness. The demons arrive at Rama's cottage guided by Shuurpanakha and they wage a war with Rama in which Rama destructs all their weaponry and eliminates them all. Seeing this defeat Shuurpanakha rushes back to her brother to report the defeat. 

The resounding defeat of Khara and his army reach the ears of Ravana, who becomes consumed with revenge and a burning desire to possess Sita. Ravana is no ordinary demon; he is a powerful being with extraordinary abilities and unmatched strength. Determined to fulfil his lustful desires, Ravana devises a treacherous plan to abduct Sita. 

Ravana seeks Maareecha's help to abduct Seetha. He asks Maareecha to assume the shape of a golden deer and lure Seetha, and then Seetha asks Rama and Lakshmana to fetch that golden deer. If Rama and Lakshmana are distracted from the hermitage, Ravana can safely abduct Seetha. Listening to this Maareecha is struck dead because he is already struck with the arrow of Rama when he was in Tataka forest. As such, Maareecha tries to explain Ravana about Rama's quintessence. 

Maareecha advises Ravana to stay away from Rama of his own unpleasant experience with Rama's arrow when he was in Tataka forest and portrays a gruesome picture of Rama to Ravana, asking him to not to meddle with Rama's affairs. 

Ravana rebuts Maareecha for giving unasked advice and details his plan to abduct Seetha. Ravana intimidates Maareecha that he himself will kill Maareecha immediately if his orders are disobeyed, and Maareecha may perhaps have no opportunity to die at the hands of Rama. 

Maareecha dissuades Ravana again and warns him of the fatal consequences. In every utterance, Maareecha repeats that not only Ravana but the entire demonic race is also going to ruin due to Ravana's impertinence.
